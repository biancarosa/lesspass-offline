# lesspass-offline

This is a version of a stateless password manager I admire a lot called [lesspass](https://www.lespass.com). Hopefully, it is a momentarily fork of it because I have every intention of merging those features in the main code. Meanwhile, I am keeping this version for whoever finds it useful to use.

LessPass offline is essentialy just the front-end of lesspass, consisting of a couple of changes on lesspass-pure that allows users to import/export their password profiles and remain completely offline.

You can access it under [lesspass-offline.biancarosa.com.br/](https://lesspass-offline.biancarosa.com.br) or download a zip in the releases folder and run it locally.
